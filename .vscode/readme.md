Pokemon Battle Game built with Pygame

The utilities folder contains scripts to help download sprite assets and add the sprite file names to the Pokemon datasets.

Credits:

Pokemon stats and move datasets downloaded from hiimvincent's poke-battle-sim project. I also learnt a lot from looking through the project's code:

Click clack code's python-pokemon tutorial was also a valuable resource:
